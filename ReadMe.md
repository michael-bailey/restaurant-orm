# Restaurant Project

This is an example of using node js, along with express, handlebars and sequalise, to create a full stack application following the RESTful API design, and CRUD functionality.

There are four main goals 

* Use Sequelize to create a Object Relational Mapping database for Restaurants, Menus and Menu Items.
* Use Express js to serve web pages to display the contents of the database in a usable way
* Use handle bars to create template webpages to render the contents of the page in a dynamic manner.
* use express to modify the contents of the database and update the view.

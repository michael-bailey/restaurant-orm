                    This should be a page about me. but to be honest, i have no idea what to put here<br/>

                    So let start with the fact i love computers, programming, games, science, and music<br/>

                    I play the piano (But not as often as i should), but would class myself as able to read music and learn new peices but not to a high standard.<br/>
                    e.g i can read music and with time learn to play it.<br/>

                    I do karate and have achieved my 1st dan black belt, which i am not progressing to further dans (however due to covid there has been issues with this)<br/>

                    i also do swimming, to which lead to my first job as a life guard.<br/>
